Welcome to my first reverse engineering and binary exploitation repository!

This repo contains detailed writeups and exploit code for challenges from [pwnable.kr](https://pwnable.kr), starting from Challenge 4 onward.

Why challenge 4 and onward? Because I already completed 1–3 before deciding to create this repo. So I thought it wouldn't be fun to redo them since I already know how to solve those.

## About me

I'm a beginner reverse engineer learning by solving CTF-style challenges and documenting my progress.

A lot of people can probably relate — challenges sometimes get repetitive and monotone, so I decided to create writeups in a fancy text editor to lessen the boredom. I'm currently using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is free and gets the job done.

I highly recommend, if you haven't already, creating writeups. It makes learning way more fun as you document these binary puzzles, and you can also see your progress which lessens the boredom even more.
